* Contributed to a C++ library called MSVP that enabled test script writers to carry out validation, quality checks, firmware
testing, and spec compliance testing of Solid-state drives. This library is the single tool used worldwide across Samsung by 15+
teams to validate storage controllers and firmware developed for vendors like HPE and Dell for all market SSD products.
* Developed a cross-platform desktop GUI application using Electron and AngularJS which utilized the above C++ library.
* Architected a tool-agnostic framework to integrate drive performance analysis and benchmarking features in the above
application using third-party tools like Iometer and FIO along with visualization of output data using the Chart.js library.
* Developed a client-side remote test execution utility using Electron and Node.js for executing test scripts via sockets and
synchronizing and uploading logs to C++-based servers.
* Designed a fully scalable system of interconnected test machines responsible for SSD Validation using the MEAN stack, with the
goal being large-scale analysis and management of test execution, test log collection, and result synchronization.
