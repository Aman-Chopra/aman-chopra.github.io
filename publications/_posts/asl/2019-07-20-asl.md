The American Sign Language (ASL) was developed in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century in the American School for Deaf, United States of America. It is a natural language inspired by the French sign language and is used by around half a million people around the world with a majority in North America. The Deaf Culture views deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability, and ASL plays an important role in this experience. In this project, we have used Convolutional Neural Networks to create a robust model that understands 29 ASL characters (26 alphabets and 3 special characters). We further host our model locally over a real-time video interface which provides the predictions in real-time and displays the corresponding English characters on the screen like subtitles. We look at the application as a one-way translator from ASL to English for the alphabet. We conceptualize this whole procedure in our paper and explore some useful applications that can be implemented.
