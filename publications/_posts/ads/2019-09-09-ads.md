In recent years, owing to the ever-increasing consumer base of video content over the internet, promoting business via advertising between the videos has become a powerful strategy. Mid roll ads are the video ads that are played between the content of a video being watched by the user. While a lot of research has already been done in the field of analyzing the context of the video to suggest relevant ads, little has been done in the field of effective placement of the ads so that it does not deteriorate usersâ€™ experience. In this paper, we are proposing a new model to suggest at which particular spot in a video, an advertisement should be placed such that most people will watch more of the ad. This is done using emotion, text, action, audio and video analysis of different scenes of a video under consideration.</p>
